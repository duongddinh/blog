# why?

Throughout my life, I had always been skinny. One day, I made a firm decision that I wanted to transform my physique, not only to fill out clothes better but also to boost my confidence. Understanding my strong work ethic, I set a clear goal for the summer of 2022: focusing on a combination of dedicated eating and working out.

Despite my efforts to gain weight since junior year of high school, I faced limited success. It wasn't until my junior year in college (2022), that I finally began to achieve a decently muscular physique. During the summer of 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, I constructed a makeshift gym in my backyard using logs, trees, and tires. Engaging in calisthenics, I even managed to accomplish challenging exercises like muscle-ups and one-arm push-ups. Throughout that summer, I adhered to a consistent routine of approximately 200 push-ups and 100 pull-ups each day. Despite my dedication, I remained skinny, with a body fat percentage of around 10-11% at the time. Upon starting college, I increased my gym visits to around six days per week. However, progress was slow, largely due to inaccurately tracking my caloric intake. Balancing cooking, studying, and working out posed its challenges. As a sophomore in college, I experienced a period of mild depression, feeling disheartened by my persistent efforts to gain weight without significant results.

# The Journey

It was far from easy; the journey was mentally and physically exhausting for me. Waking up at 7 a.m. every day throughout the summer, after a full breakfast, and allowing two hours for digestion before heading to the gym at 10 a.m., presented its challenges. I pushed myself to the limit, to the point where I needed to lay down and briefly rest in a pool of sweat after each set. I consumed six meals a day, eating until I was on the verge of vomiting. In the initial month, I gained an impressive 2-4 pounds per week. Unfortunately, towards the end of the month, I experienced food poisoning, resulting in a setback of 4 pounds. This setback was incredibly demotivating and caused significant stress, as I had worked diligently to achieve those weight gains, only to lose them due to an uncontrollable circumstance. It was during this time that thoughts of giving up crossed my mind. However, I persevered and returned to the gym with renewed determination. Through two months of relentless training, I transformed from weighing 120 pounds to 155 pounds with around 17-20% body fat.

I vividly recall returning for the summer and confidently proclaiming to many that I would gain 35 pounds within the season. However, my ambitious goal was met with disbelief from others due to my naturally skinny nature. People often make fun of me about my seemingly lightning-fast metabolism. However, it feels good to prove everyone wrong :)

# Diet

I eat 6 meals per day, 

Morning (7am): 2 eggs, oat meal, and orange juice

Afternoon (12pm): Rice with 200g of chicken/beef and spinach

After-afternoon (3pm): Apple, random snack, cheese

Night (6pm): Rice with 200g of chicken/beef/tuna and spinach

Before bed (10pm): Weight gained (2 scoops) and bread

# Supplements

- weight gainer after working out

- multivitamin in the morning

- Omega3, vitamin K2 D3 and Astaxanthin before bed

# Workout routine during the summer

Monday: Upper body day (Heavy) with benchpress, incline benpress, pecs fly, Deadlift, rowing, tricep extension, bicep curls

Tuesday: Lower body (light): Squat, Bulgarian squat, a lot of squat variations

Wednesday: Cardio: HIIT exercise for 30 mins.

Thursday: Upper body (light): Same as above but more relaxed

Friday: Lower body (heavy): Same as above but more intense. 

Saturday: rest day

Sunday: Rest day

# Workout routine now

I follow a comprehensive workout routine that includes exercises for push, pull, and legs. While I strive to maintain consistency, I must admit that my commitment has been affected by the demands and priorities of my current career and personal life. :)

# Effect on the body

I feel happier.

I have observed the emergence of significant and elongated stretch marks around my biceps, triceps, and armpit areas. Additionally, I have noticed the presence of numerous stretch marks on my legs.

Furthermore, I have observed that my face has become rounder, and I have experienced an increase in hunger sensations. It is also easier for me to sweat. 

I have three daily bowel movements: one upon waking up, one after lunch, and one before bedtime during my training camp.


# People behind this

I am grateful to my mom and my trainer for their unwavering support and guidance throughout my journey. Without them, I would not have been able to achieve my goals. <3


# The End? 

The journey is far from over. While it may not be as intense as before, my focus remains on maintaining and building muscle. Although my weight has remained the same, I have managed to gain additional muscle mass and strength. Fitness continues to be one of my top priorities, as it greatly benefits my mental health. However, it also brings challenges such as body dysmorphia. Nonetheless, over the years, I have developed better coping mechanisms to manage body dysmorphia.

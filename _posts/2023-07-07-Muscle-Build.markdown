# why?

Throughout my life, I had always been skinny. One day, I made a firm decision that I wanted to transform my physique, not only to fill out clothes better but also to boost my confidence. Understanding my strong work ethic, I set a clear goal for the summer of 2022: focusing on a combination of dedicated eating and working out.

# The Journey

It was far from easy; the journey was mentally and physically exhausting for me. Waking up at 7 a.m. every day throughout the summer, after a full breakfast, and allowing two hours for digestion before heading to the gym at 10 a.m., presented its challenges. I pushed myself to the limit, to the point where I needed to lay down and briefly rest in a pool of sweat after each set. I consumed six meals a day, eating until I was on the verge of vomiting. In the initial month, I gained an impressive 2-4 pounds per week. Unfortunately, towards the end of the month, I experienced food poisoning, resulting in a setback of 4 pounds. This setback was incredibly demotivating and caused significant stress, as I had worked diligently to achieve those weight gains, only to lose them due to an uncontrollable circumstance. It was during this time that thoughts of giving up crossed my mind. However, I persevered and returned to the gym with renewed determination. Through two months of relentless training, I transformed from weighing 120 pounds to 155 pounds.

# Diet

I eat 6 meals per day, 

Morning (7am): 2 eggs, oat meal, and orange juice

Afternoon (12pm): Rice with 200g of chicken/beef and spinach

After-afternoon (3pm): Apple, random snack, cheese

Night (6pm): Rice with 200g of chicken/beef/tuna and spinach

Before bed (10pm): Weight gained (2 scoops ) and bread

# Workout routine:

Monday: Upper body day (Heavy) with benchpress, incline benpress, pecs fly, Deadlift, rowing, tricep extension, bicep curls

Tuesday: Lower body (light): Squat, Bulgarian squat, a lot of squat variations

Wednesday: Cardio: HIIT exercise for 30 mins.

Thursday: Upper body (light): Same as above but more relaxed

Friday: Lower body (heavy): Same as above but more intense. 

Saturday: rest day

Sunday: Rest day

# The End? 

The journey is far from over. While it may not be as intense as before, my focus remains on maintaining and building muscle. Although my weight has remained the same, I have managed to gain additional muscle mass and strength. Fitness continues to be one of my top priorities, as it greatly benefits my mental health. However, it also brings challenges such as body dysmorphia. Nonetheless, over the years, I have developed better coping mechanisms to manage body dysmorphia.

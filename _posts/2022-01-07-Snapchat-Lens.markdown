# Overview

Over the past 5 years, I have created a total of 6 lenses, with 4 of them serving as learning experiences. The remaining 2 lenses were specifically designed to go viral. I currently have two lenses that are trending: one with 300k views and 200k plays, and another with an impressive 1.5 million views and 1 million plays. These two lenses alone have garnered me 1k subscribers. The most recent lens, which gained 1 million views in less than a week, has since experienced a gradual decline in popularity.

# The thought process 

So, the question arises: was I lucky, or is there something else at play? The answer is no, it wasn't luck. I have a good understanding of the market and stay up-to-date with pop culture. To comprehend how I achieved this, let's examine the context of the lens with 300k views. At that time, there was a social media frenzy surrounding Lil Uzi Vert, who had recently gotten a diamond embedded in his forehead. Initially, creating a lens wasn't on my mind since it had been about three years since I last made one. However, the next day, I wanted to send a snap with a Lil Uzi Vert filter on my face, but I couldn't find a lens with satisfactory quality and detail. This led me to realize that I had the potential to create a lens that could go viral. There was just one hurdle—I couldn't remember how to make one. I turned to a tutorial on Reddit and came across a valuable find while searching for something less significant. I stumbled upon a request for a Lil Uzi Vert lens, and since no one had responded, it indicated that such a lens didn't exist at the time.

Now, let's explore the story of the second lens. The narrative is quite similar, but I was late to the trend, knowing that memes have a limited lifespan. I had to swiftly create a lens with good quality. After creating the lens, I promoted it on Reddit (even though I didn't receive any upvotes, any exposure was valuable given the circumstances) and relied on time to work its magic. The lens experienced exponential growth until it reached its peak (S-curve).

Creating my two most popular lenses was rather straightforward. The reasons they went viral can be attributed to a combination of timing (though not perfect) and the quality of the product. I won't delve into the details of how I create these lenses since they are relatively simple in nature.

# Steps

Here is a general idea on how I create my most popular lens – travis scott. 
_I respect Travis as a singer, not as a human being. This lens was created to make fun of his apology after a tragic event. My condolences to the victims and their family._

you need [lens studio](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/download/) to do this. I also use [affinity designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) to design.

- I download the travis apology video and trim it. 
- I open lens studio, import the video 
- I set the behavior for the video and the text guiding how to use the lens
- I set the background color to black and white 
- The behavior can be seen in the two images below

### Important

When publishing your lens, ensure that you use an appropriate name, relevant tags, a compelling icon, and an appealing background. These small details can have a significant impact on the performance of your lens. To demonstrate this, when I first encountered Lens Studio, I created a lens solely for the purpose of studying lens creation. I initially published it without an icon. As expected, the lens did not perform well when I checked its progress. However, upon adding an icon and republishing it, the growth rate the following day surpassed that of the previous version without an icon. It is worth noting that the lens had already stopped gaining views before I added the icon. I did not promote the lens in either case, and it did not offer any potential future value. While this may seem obvious, altering any of the aforementioned criteria can significantly impact the performance of your lens. Understanding the market and knowing your target audience are also crucial factors in determining your lens's popularity.


# Take away

I may not possess the utmost expertise in designing or creating 3D objects, but I have a solid understanding of the market and possess exceptional skills in researching online. It is these abilities that enable me to code and design proficiently without formal training. I firmly believe that by continuously striving to enhance my other skills, I have the potential to excel in this field, potentially even compelling Snapchat to verify my account. :)  

At the end of the day, this is just a "just for fun" project that i can brag about. The number does not mean anything to me, it is just to test my marketing knowledge. 

One year later, one of my other lenses, originally created in 2014 as a learning tool (which had accumulated around 15k views over 8 years), has now surpassed all my other lenses, becoming my most shared and played lens with approximately 1 million views across the board. It appears that the algorithm truly played a significant role in this outcome. The key takeaway from this experience is simply to practice patience.

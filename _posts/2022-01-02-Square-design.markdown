_Minimalist but too minimalist_

Let's take a look at my website [null0verflow.xyz](https://null0verflow.xyz), we are going to discuss how i chose my design language.

## Opening 

As a person who loves art, I have always been a fan a minimalist design. My aim is to build a product with simplicity, minimalist, and elegancy yet still remain its productivity nature. However, I have never really learned how to create art. Throughout the years, taking inspiration from Apple and many other companies, I have designed many websites "freestylely". All the design choices I gathered are all from trial and error. From those experiences, minimalist design is always my go to. _But how minimalist is enough minimalist?_ This website has what I call "square design" where it takes minimalist to another level. 

## Color

**Color:** As a self taught designer, color choice was definitely important in creating a website. I decided to use the same gradient of a color to keep the theme of each page more consistent; I use the opposite color palette and/or the same shade of the color. The color choice for each page (except the first) is completely random, representing nature, everything tends to move toward randomness. The first page is my theme, black and white, which can be seen in my merch's website design [null0verflow.xyz/merch](https://null0verflow.xyz/merch).
I believe that the color choice for each page is easy on the eyes. You can check out the color theory to learn more.

## Square

**Square:** I have never seen anyone design a website like this, almost _too_ minimalist. Is this the problem? There is not much content in each page, waste of space? Well, I can confidently say that I invented this design. Now, it might seem "too minimalist" to a point where it seems like there is something missing. But if you are like me, who is willing to sacrifice everything for looks, you will understand that this is not the case, however. Unless this is a static page where there is no interaction between the user and the page, this design is unique and breaks the norms. Oftentimes, you will see a picture on instagram of a perfectly beautiful woman who stands in front of the building (the building only has predominantly one color), but the picture is completely zoomed out where the building takes most of the space, and the woman stands slightly off centered. This is a beautiful picture. The same applies to this "square design."

Another aspect to this design is the emphasis on less words, more images. Though you can argue that people will trade anything for convenience, and that, this page failed to deliver the convenience in each glance.

The design on the first page "trains" the user to use the website. It releases the curiosity in each shape as there is no label, which forces the user to hover on each shape to find what each shape contains. You'll see throughout the site, every shape is clickable. 

The second page conveys a sudden change in aesthetic, which sets the mood for every page, people are more likely to continue to scroll down because they don't know what to expect. With smooth transitions, scrolling is even more fun.

Each square delivers a different meaning. The first three squares contain three websites, my merch, discord bot, and older websites. Each of these has a similar design (black/white) and are for advertising; hence, they are in the first page. Whereas the two squares in the second page represent the research I did. Butterfly is the theme for the second page, beautiful and colorful of nature, perfectly introducing neural networks and true randomness. My neural network program introduces the idea of microevolution and macroevolution which is illustrated as the bigger squares where part of it roots in true random (smaller squares). The bigger the squares, the more proud and important the products are.

## Font

**Font:** I use two fonts, one is the handwriting type of font (Lobster) and the other is the more classical font (Georgia), with the exception of the third page where I use Courier New to deliver the idea that I use a lot of math and coding for this specific program. The handwriting represents the playful, curious, and natural look in the design language; the other represents more of a formal look. Both fonts connected, illustrate the convention but unconventional look.

## Art work

I use affinity designer to draw this. I am not good at drawing, but with image reference, the right brush, and the confidence in each line, I managed to draw four beautiful objects. Again, each drawing represents the beauty and playful of nature which matches the fonts.

## Square + Fluid Design

In addition to that, let's take another look at my other really proud creation – my merch website design. This website emphasizes fluidity and contemporary design language. The part that makes this website different is that it has only two colors – black and white. And only one color can be displayed at one time. You can switch between two colors. 

This gives a website a modern, clean and luxurious look. This design is useful when you only have one product of a opposite color or just to emphasize on your most prominent or newest product.

## Inspiration

**Inspiration/How I make the website:** I use google slides to design this before I code the whole website. I believe that even though the right tools play an important role in designing, with the right attitude and creativity, tools become less important. The idea of the website comes from mostly nature, the beauty and colorful of nature. Square brings the feel of stability, trustworthy, and honesty. 

## Bottom line

To answer the question above,  _But how minimalist is enough minimalist?_  The answer is _yes_, as long as you can justify the simplistic design. I emphasize attention seeking and the elegancy in my website. The idea behind this is there are many hidden meanings in every square as well as in every piece of art; you have to look for it to find the beauty. Big space of nothingness often contains the hidden world. 

**Why does this page exists?** Because I want to highlight the change and the growth in the way I design. I want to believe that I also invented this design language. 

I introduced the concept of more than minimalist design, which is practical in most portfolio cases where aesthetic is what you are looking for.

# About me
I was born in Vietnam. In September 2017, at the age of 14, I embarked on an adventure to go to the U.S to attend high school, which turned out to be the biggest change in my life. It was during this time that I discovered and nurtured my passion. I have a strong interest in programming and design, constantly questioning the world and seeking ways to make products more intuitive and visually appealing.

Ever since the world was first hit by the wave of the Wannacry virus, a fire ignited in my mind, and I realized that cybersecurity is my field. As a result, I dedicated a significant amount of time to self-teaching programming, which paid off when I moved to the U.S. However, I often feel that my products lack a certain level of "fashion." Apple has been a major influence on my design style and self-teaching journey. My ultimate goal is to contribute my skills to the community and create "cool" products that resonate with people.

I have experience in designing shirts, logos, and creating Snapchat filters for various organizations and events. Some of my skills include programming languages such as Java, PHP, JavaScript, C#, C++, C, and Python. In terms of design and photo editing, I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Photo, and Affinity Designer. Additionally, I possess video editing skills using software like Vegas Pro and Final Cut Pro. Other notable abilities include working with Snapchat Lens Studio (I have 2 million views on my lenses), proficiency in chess (qualified to play district as unbeaten), and proficiency in soccer and tennis.


# About this page.
This page serves as a documentation of my experiences and a platform to potentially share helpful insights. Consider each section on this page as a chapter of my life. Initially, it primarily focused on programming, but after a three-year hiatus, it transitioned to design. The shift encompassed moving from a gaming-oriented atmosphere to a more professional one, evolving from simply admiring products to actively creating them. Change is inevitable, and people evolve. As I approach the end of my teenage years (at the time of writing, I will turn 20 in eight months), I reflect upon having accomplished everything typical of a young teenager and more. It is now time to conclude this chapter and embark on a new oneâ€”a chapter where my career takes center stage. This does not mean that I will abandon the activities I used to enjoy; it simply means that my focus has shifted towards more significant priorities.

This page is powered by Flexible-Jekyll with modifications I enhanced to make the experience even better (this is probably the closet I got to reverse-engineering lol).

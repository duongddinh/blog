# About me
I am from Vietnam; I have been in the US for the last 5+ years (in Michigan), and have not been back because of Covid; I am a designer and programmer wannabe. I study in Purdue and majoring in CNIT (3.6 GPA hehe). I traveled half of the earth to the United States for high school and college. Living in two different countries has taught me a lot about many aspects of life. Especially when I have to live independently for the majority of my teenage years and adulthood without much guidance. Everything my mom and dad have taught me from my childhood I put carefully inside my heart; some became my values and some were challenged. I like traveling and socializing with people (which is inarguably one of the most important life skills I managed to unleash when puberty hits). I am also really into sports both watching and playing. I also like fashion, which explains why I like to challenge the conventional way of wearing. I usually come up with unique solutions to every problem (flex, i know). I love learning and studying new things to enrich myself and to give back to the world. 


# About this page.
This page is created to document the things I did, and maybe share a way of doing something (if anybody finds this helpful). Think of this page as each chapter of my life. It slowly shifts from predominantly programming, and after 3 years of hiatus, it changes to designing. It shifts from gaming vibes to more of a professional vibe. It shifts from admiring a product to actually creating one. Things change, people change. My teenage years are coming to an end (as of the writing of this, I will turn 20 in 8 months), I have done everything a young teen would have done and more, and it is time to close this chapter to start a new one, the one where I put a heavy focus on my career. Now it does not mean I am gonna stop doing the things I used to, it just means that I have bigger priorities.

This page is powered by Flexible-Jekyll with modifications I enhanced to make the experience even better (this is probably the closet I got to reverse-engineering lol).

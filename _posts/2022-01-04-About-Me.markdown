# About me
 was born in Vietnam. In September 2017, I took an adventure to go to the U.S at the age of 14 to attend High School, which was the biggest change in my life. This is where I found and enriched my passion. I like programming and designing, and I always question the world as well as how to make a product more intuitive and "fashionable". Ever since the world was first hit by the wave of Wannacry virus, the fire in my mind ignited, I realized cybersecurity is my field. I, consequently, invested a lot of time on self-teaching programming. And this came in fruition when I moved to the U.S. However, my product often lacks "fashion". Apple is highly influential in the way I design and teaching myself how to design. I always want to contribute my skills to the community and make "cool" products to the community. I have designed shirts, logos and created snapchat filters for different organizations and events. Some of my skills: programming: java, php, javascript, c#, c++, c, python; designing/photoshop: adobe photoshop, adobe illustrator, affinity photo, affinity designer; video editing skills: vegas pro, final cut pro; other: snapchat lens studio (I have 2 million views), I am good at chess (I was qualified to play district as unbeaten), soccer, and tennis.


# About this page.
This page is created to document the things I did, and maybe share a way of doing something (if anybody finds this helpful). Think of this page as each chapter of my life. It slowly shifts from predominantly programming, and after 3 years of hiatus, it changes to designing. It shifts from gaming vibes to more of a professional vibe. It shifts from admiring a product to actually creating one. Things change, people change. My teenage years are coming to an end (as of the writing of this, I will turn 20 in 8 months), I have done everything a young teen would have done and more, and it is time to close this chapter to start a new one, the one where I put a heavy focus on my career. Now it does not mean I am gonna stop doing the things I used to, it just means that I have bigger priorities.

This page is powered by Flexible-Jekyll with modifications I enhanced to make the experience even better (this is probably the closet I got to reverse-engineering lol).
